## Checklist

* Modify `package.json`:
    * Change `name` and `description` to refer to your project
    * Change `repository` to point to your project's repository
    * Change `author` if you're not me
    * Change `license` if you don't want to use Apache 2.0
    * Consider if you want to change `version` to something else
    * Consider if you want to remove `private` now, if your eventual plan is to publish to the public NPM registry.
* Modify or delete `LICENSE` depending on if you want to release your project under the Apache 2.0 license.
* Remove `.travis.yml` and/or `renovate.json` if you're not planning on using those services.
