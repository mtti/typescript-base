This is my personal backend TypeScript base project.

I try to support the newest Node.js version [supported by AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html), which was `12.13.0` at the time of last updating this repository.

## Checklist

    * Change `name` and `description` to refer to your project
    * Change `repository` to point to your project's repository
    * Change `author` if you're not me
    * Change `license` if you don't want to use Apache 2.0
    * Consider if you want to change `version` to something else
